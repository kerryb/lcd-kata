An attempt at the LCD kata in Ruby (similar to [this Ruby Quiz](http://rubyquiz.com/quiz14.html)).

For example, 123 should be displayed as:

         -   - 
      |   |   |
         -   - 
      | |     |
         -   - 

Also supports a size option, eg an eight at size 3:

     --- 
    |   |
    |   |
    |   |
     --- 
    |   |
    |   |
    |   |
     ---
